## General Information
Anyone can create their own account and log into it, they will have access to their created expense groups (e.g. Company, Investment, Family, Home). In each group you can create a category (e.g. Credit, Subscriptions, Accounts), and for each category you can create a transaction (Income, Transfer, Loan Repayment)
